Volunteer Experience
Volunteer — Crossroads (Youth Organisation) (Jan 2024 to December 2024)
Relationship-based youth mentoring & community events
•	Helped run a relationship-based programme that gave young people a safe, consistent space to feel valued, heard, and supported.
•	Planned and delivered diverse activities—music sessions, game nights, karaoke, badminton/indoor sports, trekking and adventure camps—end-to-end (ideas, logistics, venue coordination, risk awareness, setup/close).
•	Facilitated group discussions and 1-to-1 check-ins using active listening and a calm, non-judgmental approach; focused on reducing isolation and encouraging healthy decision-making.
•	Practised de-escalation and conflict resolution between participants and volunteers; reframed emotional situations, negotiated fair outcomes, and restored group cohesion.
•	Maintained clear boundaries and ethics (e.g., no romantic relationships with students), modelling respectful behaviour and safeguarding-aware practice.
•	Provided practical care—often pooling personal funds for shared meals—to build trust and create low-pressure moments for students to open up.
•	Supported career/personal guidance by asking good questions rather than prescribing solutions; encouraged students to think independently and take ownership of choices.
•	Promoted inclusion and psychological safety: ensured quieter voices were heard, prevented cliques, and designed activities accessible to mixed ages/interests.
•	Coordinated with other volunteers to divide roles, communicate expectations, and keep events running on time; flagged issues early and followed up after sessions.
•	Reflected lessons into future events (what worked/what didn’t) to improve participation, safety, and the overall experience.
Key skills: Active listening, youth mentorship, de-escalation & mediation, boundary-setting, empathy under pressure, event operations, teamwork, clear communication, inclusion & community-building.
Narrative (LinkedIn / statement)
As a volunteer with Crossroads, I helped deliver a relationship-based youth programme built on consistency, care, and trust. Our team created a safe space where young people felt heard and supported, whether during relaxed game nights and karaoke, structured music sessions and indoor sports, or higher-energy activities like trekking and adventure camps.
My role blended event operations with mentorship. I planned and ran activities, coordinated logistics with fellow volunteers, and handled setup/close so sessions felt smooth and welcoming. I spent a lot of time listening—really listening—so students could process emotions, talk through decisions, and feel less alone. When tensions surfaced, I used calm de-escalation and conflict-resolution techniques to bring conversations back to respect and shared goals.
We were intentional about boundaries and ethics (for example, volunteers did not date students) and about inclusion so quieter students weren’t overshadowed. Sometimes care looked practical: sharing a meal (often funded by volunteers ourselves) to create a low-pressure moment for honest conversation. Rather than telling students what to do, I asked questions that helped them think clearly, build confidence, and choose well.
The experience taught me how to stay composed in emotionally charged situations, negotiate fair outcomes when perspectives clash, and lead with empathy while still getting things done. Above all, it reinforced a simple truth: most people act from good intentions, and when we slow down to understand them, we can respond with wisdom—and love.
Class Representative — MCA, Anna University (Chennai) (March 2020 to March 2022)
Elected liaison between cohort and faculty; timetable, attendance, and student welfare
•	Coordinated lecture and exam timetables by consolidating constraints from students and professors; circulated clear updates and minimized clashes/last-minute changes.
•	Maintained class attendance records, reconciled discrepancies with faculty, and flagged issues early to avoid penalties.
•	Acted as the primary liaison: ran quick pulse-checks to understand how both sides were feeling, brought concerns to faculty with context, and negotiated practical solutions and make-ups that were fair to all.
•	Mediated conflicts (e.g., deadlines, group allocations, grading concerns) using calm, evidence-based discussion; sought common ground and documented agreed actions.
•	Upheld ethics even when unpopular—refused requests that risked academic integrity (e.g., falsifying attendance), explained the rationale transparently, and accepted potential backlash.
•	Supported classmates in raising sensitive issues (e.g., harassment, welfare) through the proper university channels; maintained confidentiality, signposted policies, and followed up to ensure concerns were heard.
•	Fostered an inclusive, respectful class culture: kept communication open, ensured quieter voices were represented, and maintained healthy personal relationships across the cohort.
•	Managed logistics around guest sessions, reschedules, and room changes; created simple checklists/trackers so nothing fell through the cracks.
•	Balanced these responsibilities alongside full-time study, delivering all duties pro bono while meeting personal academic goals.
Key skills: Stakeholder management, negotiation, conflict resolution, safeguarding awareness, ethical decision-making, documentation, clear communication, time management, relationship-building.
Narrative (LinkedIn / statement)
As Class Representative for my MCA cohort at Anna University (Chennai), I served as the bridge between students and faculty. Day to day, that meant coordinating lecture/exam timetables, keeping attendance records clean, and—more importantly—staying tuned to how both sides were feeling so we could find solutions that were fair and workable.
I mediated conflicts calmly, documented decisions, and pushed for common ground. When ethical lines were tested, I stood by academic integrity even if it meant taking heat for an unpopular call. I also supported classmates in bringing sensitive issues—such as harassment—to the right university channels, maintaining confidentiality and following up so people felt heard and safe. Along the way, I kept relationships strong across the cohort and managed the extra workload alongside my own studies, purely as a service to the class.
